Full instructions and print details found here: https://leapmotion.github.io/ProjectNorthStar/mechanical.html

Print one set of parts from each of the 3 modules: Headgear, Optics, and Tracking.

Some parts have versions that are labeled "FDM Optimized." These parts have thin circular features that reduce the amount of warping during FDM 3D printing by increasing the surface area adhering to the print surface. Use of these varieties is optional but recommended if you're using the same printer and filament we did.
